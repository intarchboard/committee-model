# The Committee Model of IAB Operation

When operating in the “committee model”, the full IAB meets only 6-8 times per year,
with technical and administrative efforts actively being driven by sub-groups of IAB
members between full board meetings. This operation model is in contrast to the
practice of scheduling full board meetings every week.

The committee model is intended to reduce the shared overhead of weekly meetings and
focus the IAB’s time on making progress on technical and administrative efforts.

All IAB members are expected to attend full board meetings and also take on delegated
responsibilities that they engage in between meetings.

This model is a matter of how the IAB meets and operates and does not change or update
any part of its function or charter (RFC 2850). 

### Expectations of time commitment

All IAB members are still expected to spend, on average, at least an hour per week in
engaging with IAB work.

All IAB members are expected to be present at full board meetings. Between full board
meetings, each IAB member is expected to take on at least one delegated responsibility.

## Full Board Meetings

Full board meetings include all board members, the secretariat, liaisons, and observers.
They are minuted and can contain both public portions and executive sessions. 

In general, votes are held during full board meetings. When e-votes occur outside full
board meetings, their results are minuted at full board meetings.

Reports from liaisons are received and minuted at full board meetings.

IAB members provide reports based on their delegated responsibilities ahead of full
board meetings.

Agenda items for discussion or decision at full board meetings should have pre-read materials
(e.g., background material, rationale, supporting information, alternatives considered)
available at least a week in advance, and preferably longer.

During the full board meeting, the delegated responsibilities of board members in
the upcoming cycle are confirmed.

### Scheduling

Full board meetings should be scheduled in advance, at the start of a yearly cycle for
the IAB (such as at or before the March IETF meeting).

There should be at least 6 full board meetings per year, with no more than 2 months between
each meeting. The exact timing should be chosen to best suit the needs of any appointments
that the IAB must vote on.

In-person meetings during IETF weeks and retreats count as full board meetings.

Virtual full board meetings should be scheduled to be 2 hours in order to ensure that
all topics or decision-making can be completed.

An example schedule would be:

* March IETF meeting (in-person)
* April interim (virtual)
* May reserved interim (virtual)
* June retreat (in-person)
* July IETF meeting (in-person)
* August reserved interim (virtual)
* September interim (virtual)
* October reserved interim (virtual)
* November IETF meeting (in-person)
* December interim (virtual)
* January reserved interim (virtual)
* February interim (virtual)

### Extraordinary Meetings

Virtual full board meetings may be convened outside of the regular schedule if the IAB chair
determines they are necessary. These should only be convened for extraordinary cases in
response to time-sensitive deadlines, such as voting on how to respond to an appeal or a sudden
vacancy, etc. In such cases, the meetings must be scheduled at least a week in advance (longer
is preferable), there must be a clear agenda, and some of the IAB members should
have prepared written proposals or reports to the IAB beforehand. In general, responding to
time-sensitive issues should be primarily handled over email or messaging.

### Invited Technical Talks

Invited technical talks may be included in the agenda of full board meetings, but can also
occur outside the context of full board meetings. For example, a technical program or focus
area can schedule a technical presentation from a particular set of speakers. That presentation
should be scheduled to accommodate the speaker, and does not necessarily require mandatory
participation of all IAB members (although all IAB members would be welcomed and encouraged to
join). Invited technical talks are also appropriate for IAB Open meetings during IETF meeting
weeks. IRTF research group reviews should usually occur during IETF meeting weeks. 

## Delegated Responsibilities

Delegated responsibilities are the ways that individual IAB members work in subgroups or with
other bodies between full board meetings. These responsibilities are where IAB members are
expected to make most of their contributions; full board meetings reflect decision-making
and record-keeping based on the output of these responsibilities. 

Some of these activities take place in groups that involve external community participation;
some are purely internal to the IAB.

Meetings for an area of responsibility should be scheduled to accommodate that particular
group, but also be placed on the shared IAB calendar and be open to participation of other
IAB members. IAB members can request secretariat participation to aid in scheduling, taking
minutes, and general assistance. 

Each area of responsibility is expected to provide written minutes or reports back to the
whole IAB over email, at least one week before the full board meeting. These reports should
contain a list of IAB members who contributed to the activity (such meeting attendance or
providing technical contributions).

Each area of responsibility is encouraged to have a dedicated Slack channel or email group
for discussion.

Between meetings, each IAB member should be assigned to at least one delegated responsibility.
There is no strict limit to the number of responsibilities an IAB member can take on, but
distributing the responsibilities is encouraged. The list below is not exhaustive, but represents
the most common activities. Not all of the responsibilities below are expected to be covered in
every cycle.

### Technical Responsibilities

**Technical Program Lead / Participant**
Leading or participating in an IAB Technical Program. Technical programs need not meet during
every cycle; not every program needs to be on the list of responsibilities between every meeting.
However, when a technical program is chosen as a responsibility, it should have at least one
active meeting and make some progress that can be reported back to the IAB. 

**Workshop Planning and Program Committee**
Planning, organizing, and running an IAB workshop. This also includes working on workshop reports
after a workshop is held.

**IAB Stream Document Authoring**
Authoring an IAB stream document, either technical or administrative. If chosen as a responsibility,
the IAB member(s) should make meaningful updates to documents, either before adoption by the IAB,
or as part of preparing a document for publishing as an RFC. 

**Technical Focus Area**
For technical topics that are not yet programs or workshops or documents, IAB members can work on
focus areas to determine if there is technical work for the IAB to do on a topic. This can involve
researching, working with other IAB members, interviewing external experts, and inviting discussions
from the community or external sources.

**BoF Shepherding**
Guiding and advising new work in the IETF, particularly proposed Birds of Feather meetings. 

### Administrative Responsibilities

**Executive Committee / Meeting Planning**
Planning the agenda for upcoming IETF meetings and retreats, including IABOPEN sessions. At a minimum,
the IAB chair and whoever is the current IABOPEN co-chair are expected to participate. This committee
also includes any early discussion of procedural proposals, which are later taken to the full IAB.
Part of the responsibilities here are ensuring that emails and communications to the IAB as a whole
are appropriately handled or dispatched.

**Administrative Support Group Lead / Participant**
Leading or participating in an Administrative Support Group, such as the IAB-ISOC group. In that case,
involves meeting with ISOC members on current topics in Internet governance, policies, etc.
Administrative support groups generally should meet at least once or twice between full board meetings.
Each active administrative support group should have activity between each full board meeting. 

**Liaison Coordination**
Acting as a Liaison Coordinator and working with the Liaison Managers who handle the relationships with
other SDOs. While the Liaison Coordinator positions will always be filled, the level of expected
activity will vary from cycle to cycle. Part of the responsibilities here are ensuring that responses
to liaison statements are handled appropriately. 

**IESG Liaison**
Acting as the IAB’s liaison to the IESG; attending IESG meetings and providing reports and summaries
to the full IAB.

**NomCom Liaison**
Acting as the IAB’s liaison to the IETF Nominating Committee. When the NomCom is active, this is
expected to be a very active and involved role. Reporting back to the full IAB will be constrained
by confidentiality requirements. 

**Appointment Committees**
Interviewing candidates for appointments, recruiting candidates for appointments, reviewing community
feedback, and providing recommendations for the full IAB. These responsibilities will be active based
on the schedule of appointments the IAB is required to make.

**Outreach and Events Coordination and Participation**
Coordinating IAB engagement in outreach beyond the IETF community, particularly planning and
participating in external events such as IGF meetings.
